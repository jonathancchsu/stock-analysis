Classes
Stock Class (t)
	Variables 
		ticker (string)
		Historical prices (dataframe)
		Aggregate returns (dataframe)
		Daily return average (float)
		Daily return std (float)
		
	Functions
		Get historical prices (start, end)
		Calculate daily return average
		Calculate daily return std
		Calculate aggregate return
		Plot price graph
			Plot the historical closing prices
		Plot aggregate return graph
			Calculate and plot the aggregate returns
			Modify the Aggregate returns (base = 100)
		
FCN Class (stocks np.array of String, KO, Strike, KI, Tenor)
	Variables
		Stocks (np.array of String)
		KO (float) (write 110% as 110)
		Strike (float)
		KI
		Tenor (int in days)
	Functions
		Plot stocks
			Create a df with the aggregate returns on each stock
			Plot all the aggregate returns on a single graph
		Backtest KO (start, end)
			From the beginning date, look forward Tenor days 
			If all three have a value > KO
			Plot a graph of startdates which KO
		Backtest KI (start, end)
			From the beginning date, look forward Tenor days 
			If all three have a value < KI
			Plot a graph of start dates that KI
		Backtest Exercise (start, end)
			If KI then run backtest KI first with a single date
			If does KI, then check the lowest perfoming stock under the strike or not
			Plot a graph of start dates that Exercise
