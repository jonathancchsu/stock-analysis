	Variables 
		ticker (string)
		Historical prices 
		Aggregate returns 
		Daily return average
		Daily return std 
		
	Functions
		Get historical prices (start, end)
		Calculate daily return average and std

FCN Class (stocks np.array of Stock, KO, Strike, KI, Tenor)
	Variables
		Stocks (np.array of Stock)
		KO (float) (write 110% as 110)
		Strike (float)
		KI
		Guaranteed days
		Tenor (int in days)
	Functions
		Plot stocks
			Plot all the aggregate returns on a single graph
		Backtest KO (start, end)
			From the beginning date, look forward Tenor days 
			If all three have a value > KO

			Plot a graph of startdates which KO
			OR
			Return a list of start dates with corresponding dates of KO/no KO, #of days util KO
		Backtest KI (start, end)
			From the beginning date, look forward Tenor days 
			If all three have a value < KI
			Plot a graph of start dates that KI
		Backtest Exercise (start, end)
			If KI then run backtest KI first with a single date
			If does KI, then check the lowest perfoming stock under the strike or not
			Plot a graph of start dates that Exercise
